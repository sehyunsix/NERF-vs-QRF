**IMPORTANT NOTE**: ``kotex`` crashes (known bug) with TeX live version 2022, so please use 2021 or 2023+.

Why does this school (SNU) not have an official latex template? I am stunned to find that virtually all Ph.D. students in the fields of science/engineering waste a huge amount of time looking for proper templates. What a waste of valuable human resources.

I also don't want to spend too much time on generalizing the template, as there is no reason to make a general "unofficial" template by myself (lack of ability & motivation). The best way is for the SNU library to publish the official template...
